The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial
optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine
the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is
less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The problem often arises in resource allocation where there are financial
constraints and is studied in fields such as combinatorics, computer science,
complexity theory, cryptography and applied mathematics.
