Capital equipment typically wears with age, defined by increasing Operating and Maintenance (O & M) costs and decreasing salvage values. If service is required for a number of periods, it may be economic to periodically replace the equipment. This algorithm calculates optimal replacement plans (sequences of "keep" or "replace" decisions) for circunstance where finite horizon and stationary costs assumptions can be made.

Bellman (1955) provided the first dynamic programming formulation for the equipment replacement problem, thereby relaxing the previous assumptions that assets are continually retained for the same length of time.
