A binary search tree is a tree where the key values are stored in the internal
nodes, the external nodes (leaves) are null nodes, and the keys are ordered
lexicographically. I.e. for each internal node all the keys in the left subtree
are less than the keys in the node, and all the keys in the right subtree are
greater.

If the probabilities of searching each one of the keys are know then the
expected cost of accessing the tree can be computed. An OBST is a BST which
has minimal expected cost.
