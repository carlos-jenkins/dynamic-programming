Probabilities to win is a simple algorithm that applies the principles of dynamic programming to calculate the probabilities that a given team has to win the cup. This can be done if the user provides the total amount of games to be played, the game format (where the teams are going to play, if at home or road) and the respective probabilities for teams to win if playing at home or at road.
