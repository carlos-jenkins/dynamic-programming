The Floyd–Warshall algorithm (also known as Floyd's algorithm, Roy–Warshall algorithm, Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph. A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and the paths themselves. The algorithm is an example of dynamic programming. It was published in its currently recognized form by Robert Floyd in 1962.
